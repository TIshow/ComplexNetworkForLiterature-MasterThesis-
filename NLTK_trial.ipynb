The taxation of trade routes to\\noutlaying star systems is in dispute.\\nHoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the\\ngreedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of\\nNaboo.\\nWhile the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of\\nevents, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,\\nthe guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the\\nconflict.....\\n\\nPAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great\\nspeed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of\\nNaboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.\\n\\nINT.

Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship\\nlooms ever closer.\\n\\nEXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)\\n\\nThe small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation\\nbattleship.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE\\n\\nA PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER\\nDROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.\\n\\nPK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless\\nprotocol gearheads to greet them.\\n\\nThe door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.\\nTwo darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.\\n\\nTC-14 : I\\'m TC-14 at your service. This way, please.\\n\\nThey move off down the hallway.\\n\\nEG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That\\'s trouble...don\\'t you think?\\nPR-4 : I\\'m not made to think.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM\\n\\nA door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the\\nformal conference room by TC-14.\\n\\nTC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master\\nwill be with you shortly.\\n\\nThe droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the\\ndoor and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window\\nat the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white\\nhair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is\\ntwenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several\\nexotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.\\nQUI-GON : I don\\'t sense anything.\\nOBI-WAN : It\\'s not about the mission, Master, it\\'s\\nsomethging...elsewhere...elusive.\\nQUI-GON : Don\\'t center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration\\nhere and now where it belongs.\\nOBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...\\nQUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the\\nliving Force, my young Padawan.\\nOBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with\\nthe chancellor\\'s demands?\\nQUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be\\nshort.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.\\n\\nNUTE : (shaken) What?!? What did you say?\\nTC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.\\nDOFINE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,\\nwe\\'re done for!\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY\\n\\nA hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference\\nroom hallway.\\n\\nNUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what\\'s left of them.\\n\\nThe hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the\\ndoor. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their\\nweapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the\\ntray of drinks.\\n\\nTC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.\\n\\nThe PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords\\nfly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they\\ncan fire.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nThe bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the\\nviewscreen.\\n\\nOWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...\\n\\nOWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried\\nlook.\\n\\nNUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?\\nRUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?\\nNUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don\\'t...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.\\nRUNE : That won\\'t be enough, sir.\\n\\nThe doors to the bridge SLAM shut.\\n\\nNUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!\\nRUNE : We will not survive this.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE\\n\\nQUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and\\nmetal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS\\ncrashing into the wall.\\n\\nQUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nThe CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.\\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.\\n\\nNUTE : Close the blast doors!!!\\n\\nThe huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then\\na third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs\\nthe door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the\\ncenter of the blast door.\\n\\nRUNE : ...They\\'re still coming through!\\n\\nOn the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.\\n\\nNUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!\\nRUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE\\n\\nTen ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just\\nbefore they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their\\nbattle configuration. QUI-GON can\\'t see them but senses their presence.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Destroyer droids!\\nOBI-WAN : Offhand, I\\'d say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.\\n\\nThe WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,\\nblasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a\\nsemi-circle as the smoke clears.

There we will\\nbe able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.\\nCAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous.

MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY\\n\\nQUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two\\nbuildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking\\ncreatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously\\nwatches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.\\n\\nQUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you\\'re sure there isn\\'t anything of value left on\\nboard?\\nOBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen\\'s wardrobe, maybe.\\nNot enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you\\'re talking\\nabout.\\nQUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I\\'ll check back.\\n\\nQUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street.

MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY\\n\\nQUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is\\nwalking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough\\ngang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like\\ncreature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs\\nhanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks\\nout his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.\\nUnfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly\\nappears.\\n\\nVENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!\\n\\nJAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets\\naround the market, and lands in Sebulba\\'s soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR\\nmoves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the\\nhapless Gungan.\\n\\nSEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :\\n(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)\\n\\nSEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER\\nCREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan\\ndesperately tries to scramble to safety.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??\\nANAKIN : (V.O) Because you\\'re afraid.\\n\\nJAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up\\nto SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.\\n\\nANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana.

Una noto wo shag, me wompity du\\npom pom. (If you weren\\'t a slave, I\\'d squash you right now.)\\n\\nSEBULBA turns away.\\n\\nANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it\\'d be a pity if\\nyou had to pay for me.)\\n\\nQUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.\\n\\nANAKIN : (Cont\\'d) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange\\ngoo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called\\nSebulba.\\nJAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen.

QUI-GON lets go of\\nthe tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR\\'s mouth.\\n\\nANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...\\nQUI-GON : What?\\nANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you\\'re a Jedi Knight, aren\\'t you?\\nQUI-GON : What makes you think that?\\nANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.\\n\\nQUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.\\nANAKIN : I don\\'t think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.\\nQUI-GON : I wish that were so...\\nANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the\\nslaves...have you come to free us?\\nQUI-GON : No, I\\'m afraid not...\\nANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?\\n\\nQUI-GON thinks for a moment.\\n\\nQUI-GON : I can see there\\'s no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn\\'t\\nlet anyone know about us...we\\'re on our way to Coruscant, the central\\nsystem in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept\\nsecret.\\nANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?\\nPADME : Our ship was damaged, and we\\'re stranded here until we can repair\\nit.\\nANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!\\nQUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we\\nneed...\\nJAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.\\nPADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.\\nSHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful\\nraces.\\nQUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it\\'s used\\nproperly.\\nANAKIN : I\\'ve built a racer! It\\'s the fastest ever...There\\'s a big race\\ntomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It\\'s all but finished...\\nSHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won\\'t let you...\\nANAKIN : Watto doesn\\'t know I\\'ve built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him\\nthink it\\'s your\\'s, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.\\n\\nQUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.\\n\\nSHMI : I don\\'t want you to race, Annie...It\\'s awful. I die every time Watto\\nmakes you do it.\\n\\nANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they\\'re in trouble. The\\nprize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina\\npitty bad goo.\\nGUI-GON : Your mother\\'s right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who\\nmight be able to help us?\\n\\nSHMI shakes her head no.\\n\\nANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in\\nthe universe is no one helps each other...\\nSHMI : Anakin, don\\'t...\\n\\nJAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.\\n\\nPADME : I\\'m sure Qui-Gon doesn\\'t want to put your son in danger. We will\\nfind another way...\\nSHMI : No, Annie\\'s right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but\\nhe can help you...he was meant to help you.\\nANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes!\\n\\nThe storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.\\n\\nEXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY\\n\\nThe storm has passed.

How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)\\nQUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.\\n\\nQUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and\\na hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of\\nWATTO. He studies it.\\n\\nWATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.\\nQUI-GON : It\\'s in good order, except for the parts we need.\\nWATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last\\nrace. It will take some time to fix it.\\n\\nANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.\\n\\nANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn\\'t my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his\\nvent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.\\nWATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.\\nQUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. \"The fastest ever\\nbuilt.\"\\nWATTO : I hope you didn\\'t kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you\\nsupply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings\\nfifty-fifty, I think.\\nQUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it\\'s going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you\\nfront the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus\\nthe cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.\\n\\nWATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.\\n\\nQUI-GON : (Cont\\'d) Either way, you win.\\nWATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a\\nfollish one, methinks.)\\n\\nEXT.

He gives without any thought of\\nreward.\\nSHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...\\nQUI-GON : He has special powers.\\nSHMI : Yes...\\nQUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That\\'s why he appears to\\nhave such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.\\nSHMI : He deserves better than a slave\\'s life.\\nQUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who\\nwas his father?\\nSHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him\\nbirth...I can\\'t explain what happened. Can you help him?\\nQUI-GON : I\\'m afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have\\nidentified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the\\nway. But it\\'s too late for him now, he\\'s too old.\\n\\nEXT.

Stay away from those energy binders...\\nJAR JAR : Who, mesa?\\nANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.\\n\\nJAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps\\nhim in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his\\nmouth is numb and his words are garbled.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho.

ANAKIN :\\nYes, sir!!\\n\\nANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts\\nthe power pack back into the dashboard.

DUM-4 stands in front of\\nthe engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out\\nthe back of the engine, very bent up.

What a move!\\n\\nSEBULBA is furious. He stay\\'s right on Anakin\\'s tail, crowding him and\\npushing him through the turns.\\nSEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time\\nkeeping control. One of the parts on Anakin\\'s engines begins to shake\\nloose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is\\ntrying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.\\nANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,\\nSEBULBA is able to block.\\nFinally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries\\nto go around SEBULBA on the outside.

(Incredible!)\\n\\nSEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN\\nover and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering\\nrods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.\\n\\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\\nB : That little human being is out of his mind.\\nA : Punda tah punda!

(Shoulder to shoulder!)\\n\\nAs they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering\\nrods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is\\ntremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN\\'s steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts\\nspinning.\\nThe release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine\\nEXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,\\nbut unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws\\nwhat\\'s left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants\\nare on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the\\nEXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING.

SENATOR PALPATINE,\\nQUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo\\ncongressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans\\nover to the QUEEN.\\n\\nPALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,\\nIbeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.\\nAMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.\\nPALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I\\npromise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...\\nYour Majesty, our only, chance.\\nAMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion\\nto a vote?\\nPALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid.

We recommend a\\ncommision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.\\nVALORUM : Overruled.\\nLOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without\\nreasonable observation. It\\'s against all the rules of procedure.\\n\\nA third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS\\nMOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.\\n\\nAKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate\\nfrom the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.\\nVALORUM : The point...\\n\\nVALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.\\nPALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.\\n\\nPALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on\\nthe payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor\\nValorum\\'s strength will dissapear.\\nVALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen\\nAmidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to\\nexplore the validity of your accusations?\\n\\nQUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.\\n\\nAMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve\\nthis attack on our sovereignty now.

I move for a\\n\"vote of no confidence\"...in Chancellor Valorum\\'s leadership.\\nVALORUM : What?...No!\\n\\nThis causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a\\nroar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands\\nspeechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA : Order!

Oh, no..\\n\\nJAR JAR\\'s eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.\\nFOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO\\nGUARDS\\nand PILOT pile out and join the group.\\n\\nPADME : What is the situation?\\nCAPT. PANAKA : Almost everyone\\'s in camps. A few hundred police and guards\\nhave formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I\\ncould. The Federation Army\\'s also much larger than we thought, and much\\nstronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.\\nPADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away\\nfrom the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the\\nwaterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create\\na diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.\\nWithout the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.\\n\\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.\\n\\nPADME : (Cont\\'d) What do you think, Master Jedi?\\nQUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : The difficulty\\'s getting into the throne room. Once we\\'re\\ninside, we shouldn\\'t have a problem.\\nQUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be\\nkilled.\\nBOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.\\n\\nJAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with\\ninterest, as does ARTOO.\\n\\nPADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send\\nwhat pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting\\nthe planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication\\nand their droids will be helpless.\\nQUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there\\'s great risk. The weapons\\non your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.\\nOBI-WAN : And there\\'s an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your\\nHighness, he will return with another droid army.\\nPADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything\\ndepends on it.\\n\\nINT. THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY\\n\\nNUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through\\nthe throne room.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS : ...she is more foolish than I thought.\\nNUTE : We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers\\nassembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do\\nnot expect much resistance.\\nOOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.\\nDARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be\\nusing the Queen for their own purposes.\\nDARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the\\nQueen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to\\nour advantage...\\nNUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.\\nDARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT.
